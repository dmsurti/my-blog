The markdown articles posted on my blog with all image assets.

I prefer to keep the content separate from the presentation. This separation
allows me to focus on writing and producing content instead of worrying about
how to present it.

I host my blog on [Weebly](http://www.deepaksurti.com/blog) rendered with the
[Lecia](https://boocare.weebly.com/leica.html) template. That takes care of
presenting it neatly.

With [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), I can export the same content to multiple 
formats!

Blog Layout
===

I use Lecia's Blog Layout 3 which needs images to be placed at the top of the
blog post in the following dimensions: 660 * 660 px.

I draw these images in Paper app, export to my iMac, then use the online [Tuxpi
photo editor](https://www.tuxpi.com) to add border. Refer to
`utils/border-settings-wood.png` for the wooden frame border settings to apply.
