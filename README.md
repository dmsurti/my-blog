The markdown articles posted on my blog with all image assets.

I prefer to keep the content separate from the presentation. This separation
allows me to focus on writing and producing content instead of worrying about
how to present it.

I host my blog on [Weebly](http://www.deepaksurti.com/blog) rendered with the
[Lecia](https://boocare.weebly.com/leica.html) template. That takes care of
presenting it neatly.

With [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), I can export the same content to multiple 
formats!
